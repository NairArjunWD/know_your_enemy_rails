# Know Your Enemy - Rails Version

This is a Rails project that's a redo of my original DOM project of the same name. The project uses assets from the FATE series and object of the game is a quiz game where you are quizzed on your opponent's servent (historical/ mythological figure). The more you know about your opponent's servant, the more damge you inflict on them.

Rules and historical figures may or may not change so I'll update once I have that done.

## How to Play 

This is a fighting game based on characters from the Fate series (whom are based on either historical or mythological figures) where to land a successful attack, you need to answer the trivia question correctly. However, the trivia question will not be on your own character, but that of your opponent's; each correct answer is a successful strike on the enemy.

## Character Selection

Once a character is chosen, their character selection will disappear. Once both people select their character, they're be taken to the battle screen. Each person will have their character's portrait with a list of lines they'll say depending on the situation that is unique to each character.
