# Know Your Enemy - Rails Version

This is a Rails project that's a redo of my original DOM project of the same name. The project uses assets from the FATE series and object of the game is a quiz game where you are quizzed on your opponent's servent (historical/ mythological figure). The more you know about your opponent's servant, the more damge you inflict on them.

Rules and historical figures may or may not change so I'll update once I have that done.
